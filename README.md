This feature enables guests to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price range, number of guests, dates, and amenities. Advanced filtering options help users quickly narrow down results to find properties that match their specific needs. A robust search system is critical for user satisfaction and ensures guests can easily discover suitable accommodations.

---

### 4. Booking System
**Description:**  
The booking system allows guests to reserve properties for specific dates, view availability calendars, and receive booking confirmations. It manages the entire booking lifecycle including booking creation, modification, cancellation, and status tracking (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled). This is the core transactional feature that enables the platform's primary business function of connecting guests with properties.

---

### 5. Payment Integration
**Description:**  
This feature handles secure payment processing for bookings using integrated payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal. It manages payment authorization, capture, refunds, and maintains transaction records for both guests and hosts. Secure and reliable payment processing is crucial for building trust and ensuring smooth financial transactions on the platform.

---

### 6. Review and Rating System
**Description:**  
The review system allows guests to leave ratings and written feedback for properties after their stay, helping future guests make informed decisions. Hosts can also view and respond to reviews, creating transparency and accountability within the platform. This feature builds trust in the community and helps maintain quality standards across all listings.

---

### 7. Notifications System
**Description:**  
This feature sends real-time notifications to users about important events such as booking confirmations, payment receipts, check-in reminders, new messages, and review requests. Notifications can be delivered via email, SMS, or in-app alerts. Keeping users informed enhances engagement and ensures they don't miss critical updates about their bookings or listings.
